## 1.1 Infinite Probability Spaces

**Infinite Probability Space**: A situation in which a random experiment with infinitely many possible outcomes is conducted. 
**Two Experiments**   
- (i) choose a number from the unit interval [0,1]
- (ii) toss a coin infinitely many times

For  (i), sample space: $\omega$ = the unite interval [0, 1].  
For (ii), sample space: $\Omega_\inf$ = the set of infinite sequences of $H_s$ and $T_s$.

### Definition 1.1.1 
Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set, and let $F$ be a collection of subsets of $\Omega$. We say that $F$ is a $\sigma$-algebra (or $\sigma$-field) provided that:

(i) the empty set $0$ belongs to $F$  
(ii) whenever a set $A$ belgons to $F$, its  complement $A^c$ also belongs to $F$, and    
(iii) wheenver a sequence of sets $A_1$, $A_2$, ... belongs to $F$, their union $\cup_{n=1}^{\inf} A_n$ also belongs to $F$.

### Definition 1.1.2 
Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set, and let $F$ be a collection of subsets of $\Omega$. A probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ is a function that, to every set $A \subset F$, assigns a number in [0, 1], *called* the probability of $A$ and written $\mathbb{P}(A)$. We requre:

(i) $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1 and   
(ii) (countable additivity) whenever $A_1$, $A_2$,... is a sequence of disjoint sets in $F$, then  
$$\mathbb{P}(\cup_{n=1}^{\inf} A_n) = \Sigma_{n=1}^{\inf} \mathbb{P}(A_n).$$  
*The triple* ($\Omega$, $F$, $\mathbb{P}$) *is called* a probability space.

## 1.1 Infinite Probability Spaces

**Definition**: A situation in which a random experiment with infinitely many possible outcomes is conducted. 
**Two Experiments**   
- (i) choose a number from the unit interval [0,1]
- (ii) toss a coin infinitely many times

For  (i), sample space: $\omega$ = the unite interval [0, 1].  
For (ii), sample space: $\Omega_\inf$ = the set of infinite sequences of *$H_s$* and *$T_s$*.
